**Code Explanation** by _Mhmdmsvi24_ for better learning experiene for myself and maybe You!

# The purpose of this project:

This project is meant to create a SPA using _HTMX + Go_ each thu and fri I move further away from my main stack
(Front End) and I dive into exploring the Computer Science universe.

What's the advantages? many! learning more, better viewport, better understanding how things work, easy

## This Project:

In this Project that _ThePrimeagen_ lectures in Front End Masters we meant to build a project using

1. HTMX
2. Go
3. Echo Framework

This Go application is a simple web server that serves HTML templates and maintains a count that can be incremented via a POST request. It uses the Echo framework for routing and middleware, and it leverages
Go's html/template package for rendering HTML views.

TIP: Code explained inside the source code step by step by me
